Equal Experts data analysis assessment 

### Context and requirements:
The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) makes regular data dumps of its records publicly available. A database containing a subset of these records has been made.

The data is stored in a postgres database with two linked tables:
- artist
- artwork

Using the provided database, create an interactive, visually-engaging dashboard that allows non-technical users to

- View the number of artworks available in the collection
- See a breakdown of artist demographics (i.e. gender, nationality)

The dashboard should provide functionality to filter by:

- Department
- Date range
